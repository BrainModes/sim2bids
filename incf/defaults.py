## Welcome!

        Here you can select the folder(s) that you want to transform. Beware that we are using recursive walk to select all the content
        available in the specified folder. That means if the folder contains a sub-folder, we will transform the content if it falls
        into the accepted file formats.

        Below you will see the generated folder with content as specified at [BIDS Computational Model Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NT1ERdL41oz3NibIFRyVQ2iR8xH-dKY-lRCB4eyVeRo/edit?usp=sharing).
        If you are happy with the results, press `Transform Files` button at the bottom of the screen. We will not start generation
        until you press the button below.
